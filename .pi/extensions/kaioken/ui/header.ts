/**
 * The Kaioken header, as a Pi component.
 *
 * Pi's built-in header is one bold word and a version. This replaces it with
 * the banner all three Kaioken generations have shipped: the block wordmark
 * under its amber→red gradient, a neofetch panel carrying the things you
 * cannot otherwise see together — repo, branch, model, provider, whether a key
 * is set, and what `.kaioken/` currently holds — and the key legend.
 *
 * It is a component rather than a block of printed text because two of the
 * three things it does need a live frame: the entrance plays once on the first
 * paint, and the rule under the wordmark sweeps while a run is in flight. A
 * static string cannot do either.
 *
 * The animation stops. That is the design, not a limitation: DESIGN.md's axiom
 * is *if everything glows, nothing communicates*, so the entrance is spent
 * once at startup and the sweep only runs while there is work to indicate.
 * An idle header is completely still.
