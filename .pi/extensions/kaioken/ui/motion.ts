/**
 * Motion.
 *
 * Ported from the v2 TUI (`kaioken_v2/apps/tui/src/motion.ts`). DESIGN.md's
 * axiom binds here exactly as it did there: *if everything glows, nothing
 * communicates*. Every effect in this file indicates a state — work in
 * flight, a stream still arriving, a power level that costs real money. None
 * of them is decoration, and none of them runs while the interface is idle.
 *
 * Two rules make that practical:
 *
 * - Every animation is a **pure function of elapsed milliseconds**. The phase
 *   comes from the wall clock, not from a frame counter, so the durations are
 *   exactly the ones DESIGN.md §2.5 names no matter how fast the shell ticks —
 *   and every frame is reachable from a test with no terminal and no timers.
 * - Motion can be switched off wholesale. §6.5 requires it, and a terminal
 *   multiplexer over a slow link is reason enough on its own.
