## Global Implementation Plan: Category 11

### 1. Strategic Objective
Provide rapid, authoritative verification by auto-detecting native test frameworks, demangling stack traces, and running test repair loops.

### 2. Execution Phases & Milestones

| Phase | Milestone Scope | Core Focus & Deliverables | Feature Slice |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 1** | **Immediate Friction Elimination** | Implement multi-runtime test command auto-detection (Node, Python, Go, Rust, Deno) with streaming test consoles (Features UX-1001 to UX-1030). | `#UX-1001` – `#UX-1030` |
| **Phase 2** | **Architectural Deepening** | Add structured failure parsing (file, line, assertion diff) and inline stack trace demanglers (Features UX-1031 to UX-1070). | `#UX-1031` – `#UX-1070` |
| **Phase 3** | **Hardening & Intelligence** | Deploy automated test failure repair loops, flaky test quarantine badges, and pre-merge pass/fail gates (Features UX-1071 to UX-1100). | `#UX-1071` – `#UX-1100` |

### 3. Core Architectural Invariants & Guarantees
- **Invariant 1 (Public Pi Extension Seams)**: Zero core forks or monkey-patching of `@mario/pi`; clean extension lifecycle hooks.
- **Invariant 10 (100% Offline-Testable)**: Zero hard network dependencies; all mocks, parsers, and UI components must be fully verifiable offline.
- **Defensive Error Boundaries**: Every user interaction, render cycle, and file parser must fail soft without crashing the TUI or host process.

### 4. Verification & Testing Checklist
- [ ] Run domain unit test suite: `npx vitest run kaioken/verify/test`
- [ ] Verify zero-allocation memory pooling and no event listener leaks
- [ ] Test graceful fallback on dumb terminals (`TERM=dumb`) or non-TTY outputs
- [ ] Validate edge-case inputs (empty strings, huge context files, circular links)
- [ ] Verify integration with fake Pi test harness (`test/fake-pi.ts`)
