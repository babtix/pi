## Global Implementation Plan: Category 12

### 1. Strategic Objective
Eliminate AI hallucinations in generated artifacts through strict citation grounding, O(1) basename index verification, and padding detection.

### 2. Execution Phases & Milestones

| Phase | Milestone Scope | Core Focus & Deliverables | Feature Slice |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 1** | **Immediate Friction Elimination** | Deploy O(1) basename lookup maps and quote anchor fuzzy matchers validating file citations (Features UX-1101 to UX-1130). | `#UX-1101` – `#UX-1130` |
| **Phase 2** | **Architectural Deepening** | Implement anti-hallucination shields, generic boilerplate/padding detectors, and grounding confidence scores (Features UX-1131 to UX-1170). | `#UX-1131` – `#UX-1170` |
| **Phase 3** | **Hardening & Intelligence** | Deliver interactive claim audit views, symbol existence cross-validators, and mechanistic repair guidance prompts (Features UX-1171 to UX-1200). | `#UX-1171` – `#UX-1200` |

### 3. Core Architectural Invariants & Guarantees
- **Invariant 1 (Public Pi Extension Seams)**: Zero core forks or monkey-patching of `@mario/pi`; clean extension lifecycle hooks.
- **Invariant 10 (100% Offline-Testable)**: Zero hard network dependencies; all mocks, parsers, and UI components must be fully verifiable offline.
- **Defensive Error Boundaries**: Every user interaction, render cycle, and file parser must fail soft without crashing the TUI or host process.

### 4. Verification & Testing Checklist
- [ ] Run domain unit test suite: `npx vitest run kaioken/verifycore/test`
- [ ] Verify zero-allocation memory pooling and no event listener leaks
- [ ] Test graceful fallback on dumb terminals (`TERM=dumb`) or non-TTY outputs
- [ ] Validate edge-case inputs (empty strings, huge context files, circular links)
- [ ] Verify integration with fake Pi test harness (`test/fake-pi.ts`)
