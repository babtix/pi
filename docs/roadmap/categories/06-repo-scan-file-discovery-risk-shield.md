## Global Implementation Plan: Category 6

### 1. Strategic Objective
Fortify repository scanning with sub-second traversal, Shannon entropy secret detection, and automated ignore hierarchy sanitization.

### 2. Execution Phases & Milestones

| Phase | Milestone Scope | Core Focus & Deliverables | Feature Slice |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 1** | **Immediate Friction Elimination** | Build zero-allocation fast-path scanner loops and streaming progress meters for file discovery (Features UX-0501 to UX-0530). | `#UX-0501` – `#UX-0530` |
| **Phase 2** | **Architectural Deepening** | Deploy high-entropy secret detectors with Shannon entropy visualization and false-positive whitelists (Features UX-0531 to UX-0570). | `#UX-0531` – `#UX-0570` |
| **Phase 3** | **Hardening & Intelligence** | Add automated .gitignore rule suggestions, symlink loop guards, and sliding-window boundary analyzers (Features UX-0571 to UX-0600). | `#UX-0571` – `#UX-0600` |

### 3. Core Architectural Invariants & Guarantees
- **Invariant 1 (Public Pi Extension Seams)**: Zero core forks or monkey-patching of `@mario/pi`; clean extension lifecycle hooks.
- **Invariant 10 (100% Offline-Testable)**: Zero hard network dependencies; all mocks, parsers, and UI components must be fully verifiable offline.
- **Defensive Error Boundaries**: Every user interaction, render cycle, and file parser must fail soft without crashing the TUI or host process.

### 4. Verification & Testing Checklist
- [ ] Run domain unit test suite: `npx vitest run kaioken/scan/test`
- [ ] Verify zero-allocation memory pooling and no event listener leaks
- [ ] Test graceful fallback on dumb terminals (`TERM=dumb`) or non-TTY outputs
- [ ] Validate edge-case inputs (empty strings, huge context files, circular links)
- [ ] Verify integration with fake Pi test harness (`test/fake-pi.ts`)
