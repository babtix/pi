## Global Implementation Plan: Category 19

### 1. Strategic Objective
Enable risk-free autonomous coding through isolated git worktrees, fast-forward verification gates, and interactive merge conflict HUDs.

### 2. Execution Phases & Milestones

| Phase | Milestone Scope | Core Focus & Deliverables | Feature Slice |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 1** | **Immediate Friction Elimination** | Provide one-command isolated git worktree branch creation and dirty worktree protection guards (Features UX-1801 to UX-1830). | `#UX-1801` – `#UX-1830` |
| **Phase 2** | **Architectural Deepening** | Enforce fast-forward merge verification gates requiring passing tests before landing changes into main (Features UX-1831 to UX-1870). | `#UX-1831` – `#UX-1870` |
| **Phase 3** | **Hardening & Intelligence** | Implement Windows-safe post-commit hooks, visual merge conflict warning HUDs, and automated worktree cleanup wizards (Features UX-1871 to UX-1900). | `#UX-1871` – `#UX-1900` |

### 3. Core Architectural Invariants & Guarantees
- **Invariant 1 (Public Pi Extension Seams)**: Zero core forks or monkey-patching of `@mario/pi`; clean extension lifecycle hooks.
- **Invariant 10 (100% Offline-Testable)**: Zero hard network dependencies; all mocks, parsers, and UI components must be fully verifiable offline.
- **Defensive Error Boundaries**: Every user interaction, render cycle, and file parser must fail soft without crashing the TUI or host process.

### 4. Verification & Testing Checklist
- [ ] Run domain unit test suite: `npx vitest run kaioken/gitops/test`
- [ ] Verify zero-allocation memory pooling and no event listener leaks
- [ ] Test graceful fallback on dumb terminals (`TERM=dumb`) or non-TTY outputs
- [ ] Validate edge-case inputs (empty strings, huge context files, circular links)
- [ ] Verify integration with fake Pi test harness (`test/fake-pi.ts`)
