## Global Implementation Plan: Category 9

### 1. Strategic Objective
Prevent documentation decay and truth drift through SHA256 source hashing, symbol-level provenance bindings, and freshness gauges.

### 2. Execution Phases & Milestones

| Phase | Milestone Scope | Core Focus & Deliverables | Feature Slice |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 1** | **Immediate Friction Elimination** | Implement SHA256 source file hashing and real-time visual freshness percentage dials (Features UX-0801 to UX-0830). | `#UX-0801` – `#UX-0830` |
| **Phase 2** | **Architectural Deepening** | Deploy fine-grained symbol-level provenance tracking and interactive drift inspectors showing invalidating diffs (Features UX-0831 to UX-0870). | `#UX-0831` – `#UX-0870` |
| **Phase 3** | **Hardening & Intelligence** | Add selective regeneration queues, orphaned documentation cleanup triggers, and compliance markdown export reports (Features UX-0871 to UX-0900). | `#UX-0871` – `#UX-0900` |

### 3. Core Architectural Invariants & Guarantees
- **Invariant 1 (Public Pi Extension Seams)**: Zero core forks or monkey-patching of `@mario/pi`; clean extension lifecycle hooks.
- **Invariant 10 (100% Offline-Testable)**: Zero hard network dependencies; all mocks, parsers, and UI components must be fully verifiable offline.
- **Defensive Error Boundaries**: Every user interaction, render cycle, and file parser must fail soft without crashing the TUI or host process.

### 4. Verification & Testing Checklist
- [ ] Run domain unit test suite: `npx vitest run kaioken/provenance/test`
- [ ] Verify zero-allocation memory pooling and no event listener leaks
- [ ] Test graceful fallback on dumb terminals (`TERM=dumb`) or non-TTY outputs
- [ ] Validate edge-case inputs (empty strings, huge context files, circular links)
- [ ] Verify integration with fake Pi test harness (`test/fake-pi.ts`)
