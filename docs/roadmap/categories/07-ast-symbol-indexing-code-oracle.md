# Category 7: AST Symbol Indexing & Code Oracle

> **Range**: `#UX-0601` to `#UX-0700` (100 Features)    
> **Subsystems**: `kaioken/index`    
> **Focus Area**: Tree-sitter WASM grammars, symbol extraction, re-export resolution, and cross-file references.

## Global Implementation Plan: Category 7

### 1. Strategic Objective
Deliver comprehensive AST symbol indexing across 10+ programming languages with Tree-sitter WASM grammars, cross-file references, and fuzzy lookups.

### 2. Execution Phases & Milestones

| Phase | Milestone Scope | Core Focus & Deliverables | Feature Slice |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 1** | **Immediate Friction Elimination** | Set up Tree-sitter WASM parser pools with memory recycling and regex fallback extractors (Features UX-0601 to UX-0630). | `#UX-0601` – `#UX-0630` |
| **Phase 2** | **Architectural Deepening** | Implement multi-hop re-export chain traversal, scope-aware anchor resolution, and partial symbol fuzzy matching (Features UX-0631 to UX-0670). | `#UX-0631` – `#UX-0670` |
| **Phase 3** | **Hardening & Intelligence** | Deploy incremental AST delta indexing for modified files, symbol definition preview cards, and structural linker graphs (Features UX-0671 to UX-0700). | `#UX-0671` – `#UX-0700` |

### 3. Core Architectural Invariants & Guarantees
- **Invariant 1 (Public Pi Extension Seams)**: Zero core forks or monkey-patching of `@mario/pi`; clean extension lifecycle hooks.
- **Invariant 10 (100% Offline-Testable)**: Zero hard network dependencies; all mocks, parsers, and UI components must be fully verifiable offline.
- **Defensive Error Boundaries**: Every user interaction, render cycle, and file parser must fail soft without crashing the TUI or host process.

### 4. Verification & Testing Checklist
- [ ] Run domain unit test suite: `npx vitest run kaioken/index/test`
- [ ] Verify zero-allocation memory pooling and no event listener leaks
- [ ] Test graceful fallback on dumb terminals (`TERM=dumb`) or non-TTY outputs
- [ ] Validate edge-case inputs (empty strings, huge context files, circular links)
- [ ] Verify integration with fake Pi test harness (`test/fake-pi.ts`)
