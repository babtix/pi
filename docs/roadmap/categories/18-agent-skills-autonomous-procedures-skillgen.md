## Global Implementation Plan: Category 18

### 1. Strategic Objective
Synthesize and validate reusable autonomous agent procedures (skills) with schema validation, step-through debugging, and adversarial critique.

### 2. Execution Phases & Milestones

| Phase | Milestone Scope | Core Focus & Deliverables | Feature Slice |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 1** | **Immediate Friction Elimination** | Discover build and test recipes from package.json/Makefiles and synthesize validated skill procedures (Features UX-1701 to UX-1730). | `#UX-1701` – `#UX-1730` |
| **Phase 2** | **Architectural Deepening** | Add YAML frontmatter schema linters, multi-root skill loaders (.agents & .pi), and step-through debuggers (Features UX-1731 to UX-1770). | `#UX-1731` – `#UX-1770` |
| **Phase 3** | **Hardening & Intelligence** | Deploy adversarial critique loops eliminating ungrounded claims, trigger condition matchers, and skill parameter form UIs (Features UX-1771 to UX-1800). | `#UX-1771` – `#UX-1800` |

### 3. Core Architectural Invariants & Guarantees
- **Invariant 1 (Public Pi Extension Seams)**: Zero core forks or monkey-patching of `@mario/pi`; clean extension lifecycle hooks.
- **Invariant 10 (100% Offline-Testable)**: Zero hard network dependencies; all mocks, parsers, and UI components must be fully verifiable offline.
- **Defensive Error Boundaries**: Every user interaction, render cycle, and file parser must fail soft without crashing the TUI or host process.

### 4. Verification & Testing Checklist
- [ ] Run domain unit test suite: `npx vitest run kaioken/skills/test kaioken/skillgen/test`
- [ ] Verify zero-allocation memory pooling and no event listener leaks
- [ ] Test graceful fallback on dumb terminals (`TERM=dumb`) or non-TTY outputs
- [ ] Validate edge-case inputs (empty strings, huge context files, circular links)
- [ ] Verify integration with fake Pi test harness (`test/fake-pi.ts`)
